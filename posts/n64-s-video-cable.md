The Nintendo 64 never got official S-Video cables in the PAL region. The console is even lacking some components on the motherboard to output the signal properly.

There are aftermarket cables which are mostly ment for the use with NTSC and JAP units. I tried my luck with an Ali Express cable that ended up not being the promised PAL compatible one. Luckily there is quite an [easy fix](http://members.optusnet.com.au/eviltim/gamescart/gamescart.htm) where you just solder the resistors and capacitors which are missing inside the console directly into the cable. Turned out great:

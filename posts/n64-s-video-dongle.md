In the [previous post](./n64-s-video-cable) we modified a cheap AV cable. Soon after though I came across a top quality gold plated SCART plug-plug cable and some mini SCART dongles. They undoubtedly have better shielding than the cheap Ali Express cable.

I also had a Nintendo SNES/GC AV connector lying around. These are all the components needed to make a S-Video dongle and connect it to my CRT.

In the process i found out that a plug-plug cable crosses over some pins so I tested them with a continuity tester and jotted down a little diagram:
